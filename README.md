## Fuzzy learning solution to Continuous Mountain Car

This is a Reinforcement Learning Agent that solves the [Continuous Mountain Car problem](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/classic_control/mountain_car_continuous/).

## How to run this?
This has been tested using Python 3.10.5. But Python 3.7+ should be OK.
