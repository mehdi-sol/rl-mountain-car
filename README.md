![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehdi-sol/rl-mountain-car/main/rl-mountain-car.gif)
This is a Reinforcement Learning Agent that solves the [Continuous Mountain Car problem](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/classic_control/mountain_car_continuous/).

## How to run this?
This has been tested using Python 3.10.5. But Python 3.7+ should be OK.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Wait until the agent is fully trained. After that, You will see a window where the agent will solve the problem.
